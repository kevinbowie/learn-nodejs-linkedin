## About This Course

Technology I use here are:
node.js, express, socket.io, mongodb, jasmine
I learn this course from LinkedIn by Alex Zanfir. Title is Learning Node.js
he used a little old mongodb and mongoose version.
But I renew, so you won't get any warning message of 'deprecated' that make you stress later.
At last chapter (05-server.js), it will create chat apps using express and socket.io and mongodb.
